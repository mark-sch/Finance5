CGI::Perljax

Perljax - a perl-specific system for writing AJAX- or
DHTML-based web applications.


Perljax provides a unique mechanism for using perl code
asynchronously from javascript using AJAX to access user-written
perl functions/methods. Perljax unburdens the user from having to
write any javascript, except for having to associate an exported
method with a document-defined event (such as onClick, onKeyUp,
etc). Only in the more advanced implementations of a exported perl
method would a user need to write custom javascript. Perljax supports
methods that return single results, or multiple results to the web
page. No other projects that we know of are like Perljax for the
following reasons: 1. Perljax is targeted specifically for perl
development. 2. Perljax shields the user from having to write any
javascript at all (unless they want to).  3. The URL for the HTTP GET
request is automatically generated based on HTML layout and events,
and the page is then dynamically updated.  4. Perljax is not part
of a Content Management System, or some other larger project.


INSTALL

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

*If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

Installation will place Perljax into the system perl @INC path, but it
is important that you make sure mod_perl uses this path (which is
mod_perl's default behavior, and also assuming you use mod_perl, and
not just run perl as a CGI).

Example scripts are provided in the source script directory, and can
also be seen on the project's website, http://www.perljax.us.
