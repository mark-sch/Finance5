File::Slurp.pm version 0.04
===========================

This module provides subroutines to read or write entire files with a
simple call.  It also has a subroutine for reading the list of filenames
in a directory.

In the extras/ directory you can read an article (slurp_article.pod)
about file slurping and also run a benchmark (slurp_bench.pl) that
compares many ways of slurping/spewing files.

This module was first written and owned by David Muir Sharnoff (MUIR on
CPAN).  I checked out his module and decided to write a new version
which would be faster, and with many more features.  To that end, David
graciously transfered the namespace to me.

Since then, I discovered and fixed a bug in the original module's test
script (which had only 7 tests), which is included now as t/original.t.
This module now has 164 tests in 7 test scripts, and passes on Windows,
Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X.

There have been some comments about the somewhat unusual version number.
The problem was that David used a future date (2004.0904) in his version
number, and the only way I could get CPAN to index my new module was to
make it have a version number higher than the old one, so I chose the
9999 prefix and appended the real revision number to it.
